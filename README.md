# Analyzing-Data-Case-I

Analyzing Data: Case I

The retail dataset I have contains sales information from a virtual store that operates nationwide. This store sells products from various departments and operates through different sales channels, including marketplaces and its own store.

The goal is to create metrics and KPIs for the retail store by combining and processing two databases: sales and customer data. This will involve concepts such as joining tables, combining datasets, data visualization, and making business assumptions.

#Assumptions / Metrics:
Based on the context and established business assumptions, the following metrics can be evaluated:

1. Best selling department
2. Average shipping prices by department
3. Quantity of sales per month
4. Average income for each sales channel type
5. Average age of customers per brand
6. System error: For purchases made without a state code (UF), consider the status as MS
7. Prices cannot be higher than the shipping price
